# IELTS-Moct-Test-CPP
This is a simple C++ project where I used basic C++ functionalities (including object oriented) and text files for IELTS Reading Mock Test. Students will be able to registered by admin only and they will be able to attempt tests and view results. Only admins will be able to add tests.
